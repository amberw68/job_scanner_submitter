## Context and Goals

### Background
Job seekers often face the repetitive and time-consuming task of filling out applications on multiple job boards. This platform aims to simplify the process by automating job applications through a single form submission.

### Goals
- To reduce the time and effort required by job seekers to apply for multiple positions.
- To increase the number of job applications a user can send out, thereby potentially increasing their chances of finding employment.
- To provide a seamless, user-friendly interface for managing job applications across various job boards.

### Non-Goals
- Direct employment matching or headhunting services.
- Replacing detailed customization of applications for specific job postings.

## Scope
- The project will focus on integrating with popular job boards via their APIs and using web automation for those without accessible APIs.
- It will store user profiles, job preferences, and application statuses.

## Proposed Solution

### System Architecture
A high-level overview of the system architecture, including the frontend, backend, database, integration layer, and optional machine learning module for job matching.

### Components

#### User Interface / Frontend
- **Technologies**: React.js, TypeScript
- **Functionality**: Input of personal information, job preferences, resume upload.

#### Backend Server
- **Technologies**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Functionality**: User authentication, data processing, application orchestration.

#### Database
- **Technology**: MongoDB
- **Functionality**: Storage of user profiles, preferences, and application data.

#### Integration Layer
- **API Integrations** and **Web Automation**: Handling submissions to job boards.

#### Security Layer
- **Technologies**: OAuth, JWT
- **Functionality**: Secure authentication and data protection.

### Technology Choices
Discussion on the choice of technologies mentioned above, including programming languages, frameworks, and tools.

### Security Considerations
Approaches for ensuring data privacy, secure transmission, and compliance with regulations.

## Open Questions
- How will the platform handle job board API changes or updates?
- What strategies will be used for scaling the system as the user base grows?

## Appendix
- Any additional information, references, or resources relevant to the project.
